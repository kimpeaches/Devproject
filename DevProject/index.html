        <h1>Healthy food you can eat other than your typical salad bowl</h1>
        <h6><em>By Kim Reyes <br>Posted: June 18,2022</em></h6>
        <h4>I started cooking these meals as I become more conscious with my overall health. At first, I could not live
            without eating meat. I consume meat at least 3 times a day. YES, I am very much of a carnivore. But, if I can
            do it, you can do it too! Detoxing from meat once in a while can be good to your body- better gut health,
            lower your cholesterol levels, lower your risk of diabetes, etc...Here's a list of my favorite healthy meals
            that are easy, savory, flavorful and it's meatless! Most of the dish can be cooked using airfryer or oven- I
            personally prefer airfryer because it's faster and gives that extra crisp. </h4>
